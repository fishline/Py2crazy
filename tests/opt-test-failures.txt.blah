In general, the result of a function call would look prettier if it
highlighted the body too rather than just the name

  - remember to account for more than one argument in a function, like f(a, b+c, d+e)
  - hmmm, that might be hard since the CALL_FUNCTION call might conflict
    in terms of column number with LOAD_FAST for loading the name of the function

# nested classes ... for some reason, the first opcode in a class
