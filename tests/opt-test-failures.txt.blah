This renders kinda ugly in general:
BUILD_MAP            w = {"joe" : 5, "mindy" : 6, "jack" : 7}
                         ^

same with build list and build tuple!

    return '%d %s %s' % (self.x, self.y, self.z)


# nested classes ... for some reason, the first opcode in a class
# doesn't match anything in extent_map

./opt-v3-tests/nested-class-test.out
class A:
    class B:
        class C:
            pass



In general, the result of a function call would look prettier if it
highlighted the body too rather than just the name
40 RETURN_VALUE                 return n * fact(n - 1)
                                           ----
39 BINARY_ADD               s = s + f(x)

opt-v3-tests/wentworth_try_finally.txt
63 BINARY_ADD                   print("Bye from f where n = " + str(n))
                                      -----------------------------    

  - remember to account for more than one argument in a function, like f(a, b+c, d+e)
  - hmmm, that might be hard since the CALL_FUNCTION call might conflict
    in terms of column number with LOAD_FAST for loading the name of the function

Can't seem to get the entire expression for function repeat() in
opt-v3-tests/ling-scheme-1.txt:

44 BINARY_ADD               return [f()] + repeat(f, n - 1)
                                         ^
