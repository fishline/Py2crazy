# the RETURN_VALUE instruction after BUILD_TUPLE should get the benefits
# of hysteresis (i.e., the same start_col and extent as BUILD_TUPLE).
# Right now we have hysteresis only for function calls, and that
# hysteresis might play badly with hysteresis for other types, so think
# carefully about how to gracefully handle these interactions!
