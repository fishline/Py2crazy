# there's an asymmetry when combining an attribute load with a binary
# op, which looks ugly. it's hard to fix since if we extend the extent
# of foo.first_attr to start at 'foo', that would be the same start
# column as LOAD_NAME of 'foo', which would lead to a conflict unless we
# hack Py2crazy even more :/

x = foo.first_attr + bar.second_attr
